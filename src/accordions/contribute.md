I need help. If you spot a website out in the wild that has container queries, add it to the list. You can send me an email at [havardob@hotmail.com](mailto:havardob@hotmail.com) or submit a PR on [Github](https://github.com/havardob/has-containers/tree/main/src/posts). It's super easy, just:

1. fork the repo
2. add a screenshot of the website to the `_static` folder. Please give it a short and easy-to-read filename
3. create a markdown file inside the `posts` folder
4. ensure you follow the same format as the other markdown files
5. submit as a pull request and I'll throw it in here 🤩
