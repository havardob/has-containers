# :has containers
This is the repo for a website that showcase other sites that use CSS container queries 

## Background for this project

At the CSSDay conference in Amsterdam this June (2023) speaker [Miriam Suzanne](https://front-end.social/@mia) talked about container queries and how they worked. She then got a question from the audience if she knew any sites that uses them. She had the greatest response:

> "Awkwardly people don't tell me when they use container queries, which is RUDE"

So this is a site telling Miriam (and for those interested) about other sites that use container queries.

## Contribute

I need help. If you spot a website out in the wild that use container queries, add it to the list. You can send me an email at [havardob@hotmail.com](mailto:havardob@hotmail.com) or submit a PR here on GitHub. It's super easy, just:

1. fork this repo
2. add a screenshot of the website to the `_static` folder. Please give it a short and easy-to-read filename
3. create a markdown file inside the `posts` folder
4. ensure you follow the same format as the other markdown files
5. submit as a pull request and I'll throw it in here ðŸ¤©
